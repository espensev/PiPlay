# PiPlay product and engineering specification

Actual behavior is the source and tests named beside each contract. Architecture: [`DECISIONS.md`](DECISIONS.md). Theme values: [`Theme_Preset_Differences.md`](Theme_Preset_Differences.md). Page-script policy: [`YouTube_Compliance.md`](YouTube_Compliance.md). Product language: [`AGENTS.md`](AGENTS.md). Not a media host or replacement player.

## 3. Quality requirements

| ID | Contract | Evidence anchor |
|---|---|---|
| Q-1 | Source audio stays muted/paused while the Popout owns playback. | `YouTubeDomBridge.SuppressPlaybackAsync`; `MainWindow.xaml.cs` 1 s guard. |
| Q-2 | Return preserves current video, playlist/mix context, timestamp, play state, volume/mute/rate, and window state where available. | `PlayerReturnState`, `ReturnPolicy`; `ReturnPolicyTests`. |
| Q-3 | YouTube DOM work is centralized, best-effort, schema-safe, and non-essential to app survival. | `YouTubeDomBridge`; `YouTubeDomBehaviorTests`, `RuntimeFailurePolicyTests`. |
| Q-4 | Use WebView2 Evergreen. | `src/PiPlay/PiPlay.csproj`, `WebViewEnvironmentService`. |
| Q-5 | Do not inspect credentials, download media, alter ads/monetization, bypass restrictions, or remove required YouTube controls/branding. | `YouTube_Compliance.md`; `NavigationPolicy`, `PlayerFirstSurfaceProtocol`. |
| Q-6 | URL/settings/navigation/network/runtime/script failures recover without a crash or stuck duplicate work. | `SettingsService`, `ConsecutiveFailureGate`; `RuntimeFailurePolicyTests`, `SettingsServiceTests`. |
| Q-7 | Move, resize, Pin, close/return, monitor restore, and DPI behavior are native and recoverable. | `WindowPlacementService`, `BorderlessResizeHitTestPolicy`, `RoundedWindowRegionPolicy`; WPF tests. |
| Q-8 | A visible player remains directly interactable at every fade or opacity setting. | `WindowOpacityPolicy`, `PlayerSurfaceDragProtocol`; `WindowOpacityPolicyTests`, `PlayerSurfaceProtocolTests`. |

## 5. Visual and interaction identity

Source controls: navigation, URL/search, profiles, Pin, Auto, Settings, transfer, Show Popout. Popout controls: Settings, Fade, Pin, Expand/Restore, Close, move handle. Every opened popup, menu, dropdown, item container, and tooltip uses the dark theme; every icon-only control has an accessible name. (`MainWindow.xaml`, `PlayerWindow.xaml`, `ControlStyles.xaml`, UI tests.)

## 6. Auto, Fade, and Pin

### 6.1 Auto

Off by default; eligible only for a playing `/watch` video. Shorts, embeds, home, search, settings, history, and login do not auto-pop. Launch/return uses one identity gate so the returned video is not immediately re-popped. (`AutoPopoutPolicy`, `AutoPopoutPolicyTests`.)

### 6.2 Fade

Popout chrome visibility only. Delay presets: Short `1500 ms`, Normal `2500 ms`, Long `4000 ms`. (`FadePolicy`, `PlayerAppearancePolicy`, `FadePolicyTests`.)

### 6.3 Pin

Source and Popout Pin values are independent. Source Pin is suspended while the Popout owns playback and restored on return. (`MainWindow.xaml.cs`, `PlayerWindow.xaml.cs`, `PlayerPinAffordanceTests`.)

## 7. Opacity and transparency

### 7.1 Controls fade

Pointer, keyboard, focus, pause, and movement recovery apply to the Popout chrome; the strip never becomes a second input mode.

### 7.2 Chrome auto-hide

When enabled, the idle-hidden strip collapses so the video fills the window; top-edge reveal restores it. Fade off keeps it visible. (`PlayerWindow`, `XamlInvariantTests`.)

### 7.3 Whole-window opacity

Active and idle opacity apply to the whole Popout; the Source title backdrop may also use the active wash. UI floor `0.45`; hand-edited persisted values from `0.10` through below `0.45` remain honored. Idle never exceeds active. (`WindowOpacityPolicy`, `WindowOpacityPolicyTests`.)

### 7.4 Click-through

Never set `WS_EX_TRANSPARENT`, transparent hit testing, or a transparent WebView. (`WindowOpacityApplier`, ADR-0006.)

## 8. Non-goals

No media download/re-hosting, ad blocking, restriction bypass, multiple Popouts, browser-native PiP, click-through, transparent WebView, default crop, required global hotkeys, cross-platform build, public telemetry, installer/auto-update, or credential inspection.

## 9. Technical direction

`net10.0-windows` WPF, nullable, implicit usings; `PublishTrimmed=false`, `PublishSingleFile=false`, `SelfContained=false`. WebView2 package in `src/PiPlay/PiPlay.csproj`; SDK in `global.json`; `PerMonitorV2` in `src/PiPlay/app.manifest`. (ADR-0001–0003, ADR-0007.)

- **REQ-APP-01:** one instance per channel/session. A second launch activates the existing instance and hands off a supported YouTube target where applicable; it never contends for the same WebView2 root.
- **REQ-APP-02:** exact `--help`, `-h`, and `/?` startup arguments show native executable usage and exit successfully before logging, single-instance election or handoff, settings, WebView2, or window creation. Help wins over every other argument and creates no persistent application state. Outside help, the first argument accepted by `YouTubeUrlHelper.TryParse` is handed to normal startup verbatim; unsupported arguments are ignored.

## 10. Playback modes and presentation

### 10.1 Normal page mode

Default: real YouTube watch page. Valid `PL...` and `RD...` list IDs remain in Normal watch URLs and return context. (`YouTubeUrlHelper`, `YouTubeUrlHelperTests`.)

### 10.2 Compact mode

Dormant: `PlaybackModePolicy.CompactPlayerEnabled` is `false`. Compact minimum `480 x 270` DIP; Normal `320 x 180` DIP. Compact builders omit auto-generated `RD...` lists. (`PlaybackModePolicy`, `PlaybackModePolicyTests`.)

### 10.3 Local Compact shell

Served from `https://piplay.local/player.html`. Isolated from Source navigation. Shell failure falls back to Normal without creating another player. (`PlayerShell*`, `WebViewEnvironmentService`, `PlayerShellAssetTests`.) A shell web message is accepted only when its source origin — scheme, host, and port — is exactly the shell origin; any other source is dropped before the payload is parsed and is logged once per bridge with the origin redacted. (`PlayerShellProtocol.IsTrustedShellSource`, `PlayerShellBridge`, `PlayerShellProtocolTests`.)

### 10.4 Standard and Focused

Standard is default. Focused overlay: [`YouTube_Compliance.md`](YouTube_Compliance.md). (`YouTubeDomBridge`, `PlayerFirstSurfaceProtocol`, `PlayerSurfaceProtocolTests`.)

## 11. Runtime coordination

One WPF dispatcher owns native/window state. Launch, return, navigation, and page calls are generation- or single-flight-guarded. Normal Popout DOM sync `250 ms`; Source suppression `1 s`; normal-page DOM execution `5 s`; connected single-instance client pipe payload `2 s`. Timers stop on close/navigation. (`MainWindow.xaml.cs`, `PlayerWindow.xaml.cs`, `YouTubeDomBridge`, `SingleInstancePipePolicy`, `RuntimeFailurePolicyTests`.)

## 12. Component contracts

### 12.1 MainWindow / Source Window

Owns Source browsing, navigation/profile commands, launch/return, placeholder, and shared Settings. Does not parse URLs, embed raw JavaScript, or write settings directly.

### 12.2 PlayerWindow / Popout Player

Owns Popout chrome/playback, Pin/Fade/appearance, placement, state polling, and the close report. Does not own Source navigation, profiles, or the global Settings transaction.

### 12.3 WebViewEnvironmentService

Owns one environment, data folder, missing-runtime recovery, and virtual-host mapping.

### 12.4 YouTubeUrlHelper

Parses supported YouTube video/share/Shorts/embed/watch-playlist URLs and builds normalized watch or shell targets. Valid list IDs are retained; malformed IDs produce a non-blocking fallback reason. (`YouTubeUrlHelperTests`.) `StartupArgumentPolicy` uses the same parser for command-line launch arguments; it accepts the first supported target verbatim and otherwise starts without one. (`AppStartupArgumentTests`, `StartupArgumentPolicyTests`.)

### 12.5 YouTubeDomBridge and host protocols

All normal-page JavaScript belongs in `YouTubeDomBridge`. Host requests are exact-schema, versioned, nonce/document-token checked, source checked, and trusted-input gated. Focused actions and drag-message rules: [`YouTube_Compliance.md`](YouTube_Compliance.md).

### 12.6 SettingsService

Schema `4`, sanitization/migration/recovery, atomic persistence. Corrupt `settings.json` is quarantined with a timestamp; quarantines older than 30 days are deleted. (`SettingsService`, `SettingsServiceTests`.)

## 13. Video Popout lifecycle

### 13.1 Preconditions

Browser ready; no launch, return, clear, or shutdown in progress; no player exists; target is a supported video or playlist page. A playlist-only page may use its first rendered playable item. (`PopoutTargetResolverTests`.)

### 13.2 Launch

Capture Source state and target, acknowledge mute+pause, hide Source WebView, show the placeholder, and create/navigate the single Popout with the shared environment. A first item adopted from a playlist-only page starts at zero; an unrelated miniplayer/preview timestamp is never carried into it. Failure restores Source visibility and captured playback state. (`MainWindow.xaml.cs`, `PopoutTargetResolverTests`.)

### 13.3 Source Placeholder

While active, disable Source navigation, URL, profile, and profile-action commands. Auto-off and both recovery actions remain available. **Show Popout** and **Bring video back** remain separate. Must not leave WebView content bleeding through. (`MainWindow.xaml.cs`, XAML tests.)

### 13.4 Race gate

Returns when the browser is not ready, launch/return/clear/shutdown is active, or a Popout already exists. (`MainWindow.xaml.cs`, `MainWindowLifecycleTests`.)

### 13.5 Failure

Hide the placeholder, restore Source, restore captured state where possible, report a concise error, suppress repeated failure noise. (`ConsecutiveFailureGate`, `RuntimeFailurePolicyTests`.)

## 14. Return and close

Return state is nullable; zero is a valid timestamp. Known live Popout state wins over launch fallback. Same-video return seeks; a different video/list navigates with context before replaying timestamp, play state, volume/mute, and rate where YouTube permits. Return restores Source placement/Pin and arms Auto de-dup before asynchronous replay. (`PlayerReturnState`, `ReturnPolicy`, `ReturnPolicyTests`, `MainWindow.xaml.cs`.)

## 15. WebView and navigation

### 15.2 Navigation and new windows

Source and Popout allow YouTube plus the supported Google sign-in/account hosts. Unrelated HTTP(S) targets open externally or are blocked by surface policy. The allowlist is a navigation guardrail, not a malicious-page security boundary. (`NavigationPolicy`, `NavigationPolicyTests`.)

### 15.3 Navigation failure

Failure keeps a safe URL and exposes retry behavior. (`MainWindow.xaml.cs`.)

### 15.4 Runtime failure

Missing or failed WebView2 exposes install/retry recovery. (`WebViewEnvironmentService`, `RuntimeFailurePolicyTests`.)

An unhandled dispatcher exception is logged and recovered from behind at most one message box at a time; a repeat of the same fault signature (exception type plus throw site) within `10 s` of the last dialog is logged only. Out-of-memory, stack-overflow, access-violation, and SEH faults are logged, get one dialog, and are then left to terminate the process rather than marked handled. A fault raised once shutdown has started is logged without a dialog and does not block the exit. (`DispatcherFaultPolicy`, `App`, `RuntimeFailurePolicyTests`.)

## 16. Window behavior

### 16.1 Size and DPI

Keep `UseLayoutRounding=False` and `AllowsTransparency=False` on top-level windows. (`PlaybackModePolicy`, XAML tests.)

### 16.2 Dragging

Popout chrome strip is `44 DIP` (`PlayerWindow.xaml`). Trusted primary mouse/pen drag on passive surface pixels begins only after `SystemParameters.MinimumHorizontalDragDistance` / `MinimumVerticalDragDistance`; below it the event remains a click. Interactive controls, ads, menus, captions, timelines, links, and overlays are excluded. Drag messages contain no coordinates. (`PlayerSurfaceDragProtocol`, `PlayerSurfaceScriptTests`, `PlayerWindow.xaml.cs`.)

### 16.3 Resizing

Native `12 DIP` resize band and `96 DIP` diagonal reach; not a `96 x 96` content-stealing square. (`BorderlessResizeHitTestPolicy`, tests.)

### 16.4 Multi-monitor behavior

`PerMonitorV2` is required; restore the prior monitor when available, otherwise clamp to visible work area. (`WindowPlacementService`, `PlacementMathTests`, WPF tests.)

## 17. Profiles and appearance ownership

Profiles contain a name, URL, optional mode/presentation/accent/Pin/Fade values, and placement. Non-null profile fields override global values; unset fields inherit. Duplicate names prompt overwrite/rename, URLs validate, and broken values fail gracefully. (`ProfileService`, `ProfileServiceTests`.)

## 18. Logging

Queue `4096` entries, batches `64 KiB`, failed-batch retention `512 KiB`, rotation near `1,000,000` bytes, files `logs\piplay.log` and one `.1` backup under the data root. Never log cookies, authorization headers, credential-bearing URLs, secrets, or unsanitized search text. (`LoggingService`, `LoggingServiceTests`, `AppPaths`.)

## 19. Security and privacy

No telemetry, analytics, crash upload, or credential collection (`PrivacyService`, `LoggingService`). Under the ADR-0007 data root:

| Data | Location | Contents |
|---|---|---|
| App state | `settings.json` | Schema `4` |
| Diagnostics | `logs\piplay.log` | plus one `.1` backup |
| Browser profile | `WebView2UserData\` | cookies, cache, permissions, YouTube/Google session; shared by Source and Popout |

**Reset app state** replaces app settings with defaults, removes stale settings quarantines, and does not touch browser data or logs. **Clear browser data** is separate and confirmed: closes the Popout, `ClearBrowsingDataAsync(AllProfile)`, single-flight through a `30 s` UI timeout. The underlying browser clear determines when the session is actually gone. (`PrivacyService`, `MainWindow.xaml.cs`, `PrivacyServiceTests`.)

## 20. Accessibility and usability

Every icon-only control has an accessible name and keyboard focus. Pin/transfer names state the next action. `Ctrl+L` and `F6` focus the Source URL while Source commands are available. (`MainWindow.xaml`, `PlayerWindow.xaml`, `MainWindow.xaml.cs`, UI tests.)

## 21. Packaging and release

Exact-source Stable publishing requires committed `VERSION`, `BUILD_NUMBER`, a clean tree, and a Stable deployment root supplied by `PIPLAY_STABLE_ROOT` or `-DeployRoot`. The verifier checks manifest hashes and source identity. Signing is optional through `-SignScript` and runs before hashes. (`Build-PiPlay.ps1`, `Publish-Stable.ps1`, `Verify-StableDeploy.ps1`.)

## 22. Quality gates

### 22.1 Automated contract coverage

Automated gate: `scripts/Test-LocalCI.ps1`.

### 22.2 Deployed UI smoke

`scripts/Test-UiSmoke.ps1` checks `PopOutButton`, `UrlBox`, `CloseButton`, `ProfilesCombo`, and `SettingsButton` against the deployed executable, uses an isolated data root, foregrounds the real HWND in a per-monitor-DPI-aware capture context, and rejects blank/uniform frames. Needs an interactive desktop and WebView2.

### 22.3 End-user acceptance

Listen for duplicate audio through Popout launch/return (Q-1). Exercise one real playlist/mix return when available. Record unavailable account/ad/profile states as not run.

## 23. Deferred scope

Compact revival (also needs shell timeout/timestamp behavior, RD-list policy, and deployed acceptance), alternate main-window layouts, chrome-only/video-opaque transparency, curve-following outer border/shadow styling, tray mode, optional global hotkeys, and import/export.

## 24. Unresolved work

- **Q-1 live audio proof:** Source suppression reasserts every `1 s` (`MainWindow.xaml.cs`). Tests and visual smoke cannot certify no brief acoustic overlap during ads, autoplay-next, SPA rerenders, or `start_radio=1`. On Stable v0.13.2 b39 a plain-video pop-out and return produced no overlap by ear; those other paths remain unobserved.
- **Runtime-scheme policy:** `NavigationPolicy.IsAllowed` permits top-level `about:`, `data:`, and `blob:` on both surfaces (`NavigationPolicyTests`). No recorded product need for top-level `data:`.
- **Profile-selector shadow clipping:** popup shadow inset in `Theme/ControlStyles.xaml` is provisional (`Margin="0,4,20,20"`) until opened in a verified Stable build across applicable themes.
- Exact playlist queue position is not part of `PlayerReturnState`; return preserves video/list IDs, not an index contract.

## 26. Implementation constraints

### 26.3 Video selector

`YouTubeDomBridge`:

```js
document.querySelector('#movie_player video.html5-main-video') ||
document.querySelector('video.html5-main-video') ||
document.querySelector('video')
```

### 26.4 Atomic settings save

Write and flush a temporary file, then `File.Replace` when the destination exists, else `File.Move`; never `File.Copy` onto live settings. (`SettingsService.AtomicWrite`.)
