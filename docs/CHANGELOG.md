# Changelog

Shipped user-visible changes. `VERSION` and `BUILD_NUMBER` are the current release stamp; Git retains older release history.

## 0.13.2 — 2026-08-23 (build 39)

- The deployed UI smoke now isolates browser/app data, captures the foreground PiPlay HWND in the correct mixed-DPI coordinate space, and fails closed on blank or uniform frames.

## 0.13.1 — 2026-08-23 (build 38)

- Playlist-only launches start the adopted first playable item at the beginning instead of inheriting an unrelated miniplayer, preview, or playlist-URL timestamp.
- Project guidance and the Stable release path are slimmer: one local CI command, an explicit machine-local deployment root, and no single-file/self-contained packaging.

## 0.13.0 — 2026-08-20 (build 37)

- Playlist-only pages can launch the first rendered playable item; return preserves the current video and playlist/mix context.
- Normal Popouts retain `RD...` mix/radio queues. Compact builders omit auto-generated lists; malformed list IDs fall back to one video with a non-blocking reason.
- Profile accents reach the Source/Popout letterbox, Source background wash, profile-row wash, and 1 px Popout identity edge. Intensity `0` removes shared background/edge reach while retaining primary-action identity.
- Source title wash extends through the washed background.

Release stamp: [`VERSION`](../VERSION) and [`BUILD_NUMBER`](../BUILD_NUMBER). Implementation/test anchors are in the product spec and current source.
